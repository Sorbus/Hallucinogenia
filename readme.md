Hallucinogenia is a prompt generator for the magic system described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/57ub0x/ive_been_suddenly_transported_to_your_world_with/d8w18d8/). At present it is not interactive. Support for command line flags to allow more control will be added at some point in the future.

It is written for Python 3.5, and has not been tested on other versions. It will not will work on 2.x without modification.
